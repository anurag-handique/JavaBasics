            <h2>About Java</h2>
            <p><strong>Java</strong> is a widely used general-purpose programming language that was originally developed
                by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It is known for its simplicity,
                portability, and object-oriented programming features. Java's syntax is derived from C and C++, making
                it relatively easy for developers familiar with these languages to learn and write Java code.

                One of the key features of Java is its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle, which means that Java
                programs can be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This allows
                developers to write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, or
                even embedded systems.

                Java is strongly typed and supports automatic memory management through garbage collection, which helps
                developers avoid common programming errors and simplifies memory management tasks. It also provides a
                rich set of libraries and frameworks that simplify the development of various applications, including
                desktop applications, web applications, mobile apps (Android development), enterprise software, and
                more.

                In addition to its object-oriented nature, Java also supports other programming paradigms, such as
                functional programming, through the introduction of features like lambda expressions and streams in more
                recent versions.

                Java has a vast ecosystem with a wide range of tools, frameworks, and libraries, which contribute to its
                popularity and adoption by developers worldwide. It has a large and active community that provides
                support, shares knowledge, and contributes to the development of new tools and libraries.

                Overall, Java's combination of portability, reliability, and extensive ecosystem has made it a popular
                choice for a wide range of applications, from small-scale projects to large enterprise systems.

            <h2>Features of Java</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Here are some additional details about Java:
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Platform Independence:
                Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which is an intermediate representation of the code. This
                bytecode can then be executed on any platform that has a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
                installed. This platform independence is one of the key factors that contributed to Java's popularity.
                <br>
                <br>

                2. Object-Oriented Programming: Java is primarily an object-oriented programming language. It emphasizes
                the concept of objects, classes, and inheritance, allowing developers to create modular and reusable
                code. Objects in Java encapsulate data and behavior, promoting code organization and maintenance.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Memory Management: Java provides automatic memory management through a technique called garbage
                collection. The JVM automatically deallocates memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced,
                freeing developers from manual memory management tasks. This helps prevent common programming errors
                like memory leaks and dangling pointers.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Standard Library: Java has an extensive standard library that provides a wide range of classes and
                functions for common tasks such as input/output operations, networking, file handling, multithreading,
                and more. The standard library simplifies development by offering ready-to-use components, reducing the
                amount of code developers need to write from scratch.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. Rich Ecosystem: Java has a vibrant ecosystem with a vast collection of open-source libraries,
                frameworks, and tools. These resources provide solutions for various domains, such as web development
                (e.g., Spring Framework, Apache Struts), database connectivity (e.g., JDBC), testing (e.g., JUnit),
                build automation (e.g., Maven, Gradle), and more. The ecosystem contributes to Java's versatility and
                productivity.
                <br>
                <br>
                6. Security: Java places a strong emphasis on security. The JVM includes a Security Manager that allows
                fine-grained control over the actions a Java application can perform, enabling developers to enforce
                security policies. Additionally, Java supports features like bytecode verification and sandboxing to
                prevent malicious code execution.
                <br>
                <br>
                7. Community Support: Java has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its growth
                and evolution. There are numerous online resources, forums, and communities where developers can seek
                help, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects. The community also drives the continuous improvement
                of Java through feedback, bug reporting, and the Java Community Process (JCP).
                <br>
                <br>
                Java continues to evolve with regular updates and new versions. Recent releases have introduced features
                like lambda expressions, streams, modules, and records, further enhancing the language's expressiveness
                and productivity.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall, Java's features, portability, strong ecosystem, and community support make it a robust and
                versatile programming language used in a wide range of applications, from small-scale projects to
                enterprise-level systems.
